# JobParameters folder ðŸ“‚

This folder is intended to store in one place the different JobParameters you have runned to perform a specific task, like running a Django app connected to a PostgreSQL server.

This folder usually rest under `/work/jobs` or `/work/{my-ucloud-folder}/jobs`.

These files should not rest under `ucloud/jobs` as demonstrated here, this is just for illustration purposes.
